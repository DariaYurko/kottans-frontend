During the first phase of learning Git I learned why we need Git a version control system. I got the basic skills of working with Git commands:
+ git init
+ git status
+ git add .
+ git commit -m "some massege"
+ 

For the first time, I got experience working with a remote repository GitHub and created my first  [repository](https://github.com/DariaYurko/kottans-frontend).
